# THE AMERICAN CINEMA
Directors and Directions
1968–2020*

In 1968, film critic Andrew Sarris published what many consider to be the bible of auteur film theory. It was called The American Cinema and cataloged dozens of directors from Hollywood history into eleven categories, roughly arranged from most to least important in his formidable critical estimation. The volume has continued to influence writers, critics, and cinephiles of all levels, and though his ideas and methodology have filtered into thousands of books, TV shows, newspapers, websites, podcasts, and social media discussion boards, no one has ever attempted a proper (if unofficial) sequel to Sarris’ original book. 

Until now, that is. 

Though I have neither the credibility nor experience to match Mr. Sarris, I’ve nonetheless attempted to replicate his macroscopic overview of modern movies using the exact same format he did in mapping the first 40 years (give or take) of sound films. My project picks up right where Sarris’ left off, in 1968, and organizes what I consider to be the most significant voices of American filmmaking to emerge in the years and decades since the release of Sarris’ totemic text according to approximately the same criteria he used for his original categories. 

My aim is not to predict or pretend to have guessed how Sarris himself might have categorized these modern film directors. Much of his writing on many of the films/directors covered in this project is already available in print and online elsewhere. This is simply a personal attempt to evaluate the second half of American film history (1968–2020) according to the same logistical approach Sarris used to evaluate the first half. All perspectives and opinions are entirely my own and do not reflect those of any other writer, critic, or film historian.

Thanks for reading, everyone.

*note*: film history being somewhat more unruly than written attempts to contain it, some films covered in these pages may fall slightly outside the confines of this time period.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
