**THE FAR SIDE OF PARADISE** (19):   
*“These are the directors who fall short of the Pantheon either because of a fragmentation of their personal vision or because of disruptive career problems.”*

**HAL ASHBY** (1929–1988)

**FILMS:** 1970—The Landlord. 1971—*Harold and Maude*.  1973—*The Last Detail*.  1975—*Shampoo*.  1976—*Bound for Glory*.  1978—*Coming Home*.  1979—*Being There*.  1981—Second-Hand Hearts.  1982—Lookin’ to Get Out.  1983—Let’s Spend the Night.  1984—Solo Trans.  1985—The Slugger’s Wife.  1986—8 Million Ways to Die.  1987—Beverly Hills Bluntz.  1988—Jake’s Journey.  

A product of late ‘60s counterculture, Ashby promoted a softer brand of anarchy than, say, Robert Altman, but his work has an acid-tongued (not to mention acid-soaked) rebelliousness all its own. After establishing himself as one of the best editors in Hollywood, Ashby made the leap to the director’s chair with a brand of side-eyed sarcasm and defiance of authority that defined the times.

**PETER BOGDANOVICH** (1939–	)

**FILMS:** 1968—*Targets*.  1971—*The Last Picture Show*, Directed by John Ford (documentary).  1972—*What’s Up, Doc?*  1973—*Paper Moon*.  1974—*Daisy Miller*.  1975—At Long Last Love.  1976—Nickelodeon.  1979—*Saint Jack*.  1981—*They All Laughed*.  1985—Mask.  1988—Illegally Yours.  1990—Texasville.  1992—Noises Off.  1993—The Thing Called Love.  2001—The Cat’s Meow.  2007—Runnin’ Down a Dream (documentary).  2014—She’s Funny That Way.  2018—The Great Buster: A Celebration (documentary).

“All the good movies have been made,” Bogdanovich’s character laments in *Targets*, his 1968 directorial debut. Spoken like a true critic. Bogdanovich’s style dresses up New Hollywood subversion in classic old Hollywood formalism. In short, Bogdanovich hijacks the tried-and-true methodology of John Ford the way De Palma did the grammar of Hitchcock, and it’s no coincidence that Quentin Tarantino cites them both as major influences. Like Tarantino, Bogdanovich repurposes the films of the past, but he’s up to more than mere imitation. He deals in nostalgia, but a less affectionate, more melancholic variety than QT, Spielberg, or Woody Allen. He’s not a cold director, per se, but the moments of warmth in his films feel like that of a lonely campfire in a cold and pitiless wilderness.    

**JOHN BOORMAN** (1933–	)

**FILMS:** 1965—Catch Us If You Can.  1967—*Point Blank*.  1968—*Hell in the Pacific*.  1970—Leo the Last.  1972—*Deliverance*.  1974—*Zardoz*.  1977—Exorcist II: The Heretic.  1981—*Excalibur*.  1985—The Emerald Forest.  1987—Hope and Glory.  1990—Where the Heart Is.  1995—Beyond Rangoon.  1998—Lee Marvin: A Personal Portrait by John Boorman (documentary).  1998—The General.  2001—The Tailor of Panama.  2004—In My Country.  2006—The Tiger’s Tail.  2014—Queen and Country.

The preeminent purveyor of psychedelic hysteria, John Boorman directed offbeat thrillers like *Point Blank* with a psychological intensity that anticipated the belligerent neurosis of cranky Yanks like William Friedkin and Paul Schrader. In some ways a victim of his own ambition, Boorman’s post-*Deliverance* career choices put a hard cap on how seriously he would ever be taken again. Visually intoxicating curiosities like *Zardoz*, *Exorcist II*, and *Excalibur* have aged better than any reasonable critic might have expected (Zack Snyder, tellingly, has cited the latter as his favorite film), but Boorman at his best is able to sublimate his mysticism in service of more earthly concerns. In *Hell on the Pacific* and *Deliverance*, his characters’ desperation to survive is dwarfed by the primordial indifference of their natural surroundings. His treatment of nature is grand and ominous, somewhere between Herzog and Malick, but somehow less ponderous than either.

**BRIAN DE PALMA** (1940–	) 

**FILMS**: 1968—Greetings, Murder a la Mod.  1969—The Wedding Party.  1970—Hi, Mom\!, Dionysus in ‘69.  1972—*Sisters*, Get to Know Your Rabbit.  1974—Phantom of the Paradise.  1976—*Carrie*, *Obsession*.  1978—The Fury.  1980—*Dressed to Kill*, Home Movies.  1981—*Blow Out*.  1983—*Scarface*.  1984—*Body Double*.  1986—Wise Guys.  1987—*The Untouchables*.  1989—*Casualties of War*.  1990—The Bonfire of the Vanities.  1992—Raising Cain.  1993—*Carlito’s Way*.  1996—*Mission: Impossible*.  1998—Snake Eyes.  2000—Mission to Mars.  2002—*Femme Fatale*.  2006—The Black Dahlia.  2007—Redacted.  2012—Passion.  2019—Domino.  

Brian De Palma is the proverbial Peeping Tom of the New Hollywood. Perverse enough to flourish in the ‘70s and commercial enough to survive the ‘80s, De Palma has been repeatedly labeled the heir to Hitchcock, a comparison that’s convenient enough but somewhat imprecise. Beyond his self-conscious imitation of Hitchcock’s voyeuristic (and virtuosic) camera technique, De Palma shares a certain whimsicality with the master of suspense, as well as an interrogative awareness of his own perversities. But ultimately, Hitchcock made art masquerading as trash; De Palma makes trash masquerading as art. Trademarks include: operatic slow-mo tragedy, betrayals & double-crosses, steadicam tracking shot god,

**CLINT EASTWOOD** (1930–	     )

**FILMS:** 1971—Play Misty for Me.  1973—High Plains Drifter, Breezy.  1975—The Eiger Sanction.  1976—*The Outlaw Josey Wales*.  1977—The Gauntlet.  1980—*Bronco Billy*.  1982—Firefox, Honkytonk Man.  1983—Sudden Impact.  1984—Tightrope (uncredited w/ Richard Tuggle).  1985—*Pale Rider*.  1986—Heartbreak Ridge.  1988—*Bird*.  1990—White Hunter Black Heart, The Rookie.  1992—*Unforgiven*.  1993—A Perfect World.  1995—*The Bridges of Madison County*.  1997—Absolute Power, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.  1999—True Crime.  2000—Space Cowboys.  2002—Blood Work.  2003—*Mystic River*.  2004—*Million Dollar Baby*.  2006—*Flags of Our Fathers*, *Letters from Iwo Jima*.  2008—*Gran Torino*, Changeling.  2009—Invictus.  2010—Hereafter.  2011—J. Edgar.  2014—*American Sniper*, Jersey Boys.  2016—Sully.  2018—The Mule, The 15:17 to Paris.  2019—Richard Jewell.  2021—Cry Macho.

The grim persistence of Clint Eastwood’s directorial career is admirable but increasingly impertinent. With each passing decade, his work grows more “important” and less impactful. Even at his best, Eastwood has never transcended his material. He’s never aspired to do so. That would be antithetical to his instincts, which prioritize performance and economy above all else. As a performer, Eastwood’s presence can’t be ignored, but as a director, he would rather disappear behind the camera than intercede obnoxiously on the story. However, if Eastwood prefers to let his work speak for itself, he also appears apathetic about whether or not it says anything at all. That’s not to say his films don’t express a distinctive point of view; they’re simply all taste and no flavor.

**WILLIAM FRIEDKIN** (1935–2023)

**FILMS:** 1967—Good Times.  1968—The Night They Raided Minsky’s, The Birthday Party.  1970—The Boys in the Band.  1971—*The French Connection*.  1973—*The Exorcist*.  1977—*Sorcerer*.  1978—The Brink’s Job.  1980—*Cruising*.  1983—Deal of the Century.  1985—*To Live and Die in L.A*.  1987—Rampage.  1990—The Guardian.  1994—*Blue Chips*.  1995—Jade.  2000—Rules of Engagement.  2003—The Hunted.  2006—*Bug*.  2011—*Killer Joe*.  2017—The Devil and Father Amorth (documentary).  2023—The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial.

Divisive as he was, few directors can match the visceral power of Friedkin in top form. He directs like Tyson boxed; raw fury. His stylistic trademarks include tight editing, violent bursts of vulgarity, and occasional detours into pre-Lynchian surrealism. His profane style and perverse thematic concerns mask a quietly advanced and subversive approach to storytelling, though that’s at least partially attributable to the remarkable collection of writers with whom he’s collaborated (Letts, Blatty, etc.).  Question: who exactly *is* the protagonist of *The Exorcist*? It’s not an open-and-shut case, despite Ellen Burstyn’s bulk of screen time and gut-wrenching performance. Is Father Karras not the one who ultimately confronts and banishes the story’s central antagonist, the demon Pazuzu? And what about Father Merrin, the titular exorcist? After all, it’s his opening scenes in the Iraqi desert that set the stage for that final confrontation in Regan’s bedroom, and it’s his arrival in Act III that catalyzes the film’s most iconic moments. *The Exorcist* explores the ways we try and ultimately fail to protect our loved ones from the inexplicable and myriad miseries of human existence: pain, suffering, and, finally, death itself.

**RICHARD LINKLATER** (1960–	)

**FILMS:** 1990—Slacker.  1993—*Dazed and Confused*.  1995—*Before Sunrise*.  1996—SubUrbia.  1998—The Newton Boys.  2001—*Waking Life*, Tape.  2003—*School of Rock*.  2004—*Before Sunset*.  2005—Bad News Bears.  2006—*A Scanner Darkly*, Fast Food Nation.  2008—Me and Orson Welles.  2011—Bernie.  2013—*Before Midnight*.  2014—*Boyhood*.  2016—*Everybody Wants Some\!\!*  2017—Last Flag Flying.  2019—Where’d You Go, Bernadette.  2021—Apollo 10 ½.  2023—Hitman.

Warm and optimistic, dorm-room stoner philosopher, fantastical naturalism,

**SIDNEY LUMET** (1924–2011)

**FILMS:** 1957—*12 Angry Men*.  1958—Stage Struck.  1959—That Kind of Woman.  1960—*The Fugitive Kind*.  1962—A View from the Bridge, *Long Day’s Journey into Night*.  1964—*The Pawnbroker*, Fail Safe.  1965—The Hill.  1966—The Group.  1967—The Deadly Affair.  1968—Bye Bye Braverman, The Sea Gull.  1969—The Appointment.  1970—Last of the Mobile Hot Shots.  1971—The Anderson Tapes.  1972—Child’s Play.  1973—*Serpico*, *The Offence*.  1974—*Murder on the Orient Express*, Lovin’ Molly.  1975—*Dog Day Afternoon*.  1976—*Network*.  1977—Equus.  1978—*The Wiz*.  1980—Just Tell Me What You Want.  1981—*Prince of the City*.  1982—*The Verdict*, Deathtrap.  1983—Daniel.  1984—Garbo Talks.  1986—Power, The Morning After.  1988—Running on Empty.  1989—Family Business.  1990—Q\&A.  1992—A Stranger Among Us.  1993—Guilty as Sin.  1996—Night Falls on Manhattan.  1997—Critical Care.  1999—Gloria.  2006—Find Me Guilty.  2007—*Before the Devil Knows You’re Dead*.

clear eyed pragmatism, spotlight on performance, deliberately avoided inserting himself in between the actors and the material.

**TERRENCE MALICK** (1943–		)

**FILMS:** 1973—*Badlands*.  1978—*Days of Heaven*.  1998—*The Thin Red Line*.  2005—*The New World*.  2011—*The Tree of Life*.  2012—To the Wonder.  2015—Knight of Cups.  2016—Voyage of Time (documentary).  2017—Song to Song.  2019—*A Hidden Life*.

American analog to German new wave directors like Herzog and Win Wenders, though less of a surrealist and more an Impressionist. Pioneered a type of mystical naturalism that has been received with both rapturous praise and sneering disdain. Visually, he reaches beyond the traditional boundaries of classic Hollywood formalism towards a more improvisational and poetic cinematic language. Thematically, he’s interested in the relationship between man and nature. He’s still somewhat controversial among critics who find his style hollow or pretentious, but his influence on the modern grammar of film is undeniable. One might either scoff or swoon at the mention of his name, and a legion of cinephiles would rally in support.

**MICHAEL MANN** (1943–		)

**FILMS:** 1979—The Jericho Mile (TV movie). 1981—*Thief*.  1983—The Keep.  1986—*Manhunter*.  1992—*The Last of the Mohicans*.  1995—*Heat*.  1999—*The Insider*.  2001—Ali.  2004—*Collateral*.  2006—Miami Vice.  2009—Public Enemies.  2015—Blackhat.  2023—Ferrari.

There’s something Zenlike in the psychology of Mann’s protagonists, who can only feel alive with nothing to lose. “People who want to put in 50-60 hours a week and go home and are not really conscious of life moving by, don’t really interest me very much,” Mann said in an interview for *Thief*, his feature debut.    

**SAM MENDES** (1965–	)

**FILMS:** 1999—*American Beauty*.  2002—*Road to Perdition*.  2005—*Jarhead*.  2008—Revolutionary Road.  2009—Away We Go.  2012—*Skyfall*.  2015—Spectre.  2019—*1917*.

**ALAN J. PAKULA** (1928–1998) 

FILMS: 1969—The Sterile Cuckoo.  1971—*Klute*.  1973—Love and Pain and the Whole Damn Thing.  1974—*The Parallax View*.  1976—*All the President’s Men*.  1978—Comes a Horseman.  1979—Starting Over.  1981—Rollover.  1982—*Sophie’s Choice*.  1986—Dream Lover.  1987—Orphans.  1989—See You in the Morning.  1990—*Presumed Innocent*.  1992—Consenting Adults.  1993—*The Pelican Brief*.  1997—The Devil’s Own.

The standard bearer for paranoia thrillers.

**SAM PECKINPAH** (1925–1984)

**FILMS:** 1961—The Deadly Companions.  1962—Ride the High Country.  1965—Major Dundee.  1969—*The Wild Bunch*.  1970—The Ballad of Cable Hogue.  1971—*Straw Dogs*.  1972—*The Getaway*, Junior Bonner.  1973—*Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid*.  1974—Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia.  1975—The Killer Elite.  1977—Cross of Iron.  1978—Convoy.  1983—The Osterman Weekend.

The boisterous masculinity and operatic violence of Peckinpah’s films were revelatory in the 1960s, fashionable in the ‘70s, and cliche by the ‘80s. His subversive revisionist westerns *The Wild Bunch* and *Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid*, which evoked the dizzy depravity and existential mania of the Vietnam era, remain the last word on the genre’s artistic development despite the inspired revisionism of Clint Eastwood, Robert Altman, and others.

**ROMAN POLANSKI** (1933–	      )

**FILMS:** 1962—Knife in the Water.  1965—Repulsion.  1966—Cul-de-sac.  1967—The Fearless Vampire Killers.  1968—*Rosemary’s Baby*.  1971—Macbeth.  1972—What?  1974—*Chinatown*.  1976—The Tenant.  1979—Tess.  1986—Pirates.  1988—Frantic.  1992—*Bitter Moon*.  1994—Death and the Maiden.  1999—The Ninth Gate.  2002—*The Pianist*.  2005—Oliver Twist.  2010—*The Ghost Writer*.  2011—Carnage.  2013—Venus in Fur.  2017—Based on a True Story.  2019—An Officer and a Spy.  2023—The Palace.

Roman Polanski represents the cinema of alienation. He puts the spectator in the position of a stranger in a strange room, fumbling for a light switch in the dark. Polanski’s formal rigor and cynical, pitch black sense of humor set the template for morbid jokers like David Fincher, a filmmaker with whom he shares a devilish intellect and taste for the distasteful. The quintessential Polanski image depicts two foregrounded figures with an ominous third framed between them, silently spying in the background. But with whom does Polanski identify, the spy or the one(s) being spied upon? As both a voyeur in the Hitchcock tradition — one of his earliest student films depicts a Peeping Tom — and Holocaust survivor brought up in Nazi-occupied Poland, the answer is both. And that is the point of Polanski, not just the paranoia, but the cycles of abuse it engenders. 

Even before Polanski’s career was derailed by scandal in the late ‘70s, his characters frequently danced on the line between victim and aggressor. A twisted sexual pathology is at work both below and at sea level of his feature debut *Knife in the Water*, which, like *Cul-de-sac* and *Death and the Maiden*, is centered around a queasy love/hate triangle between a nebbishy husband, his hot-to-trot wife, and a menacing outsider whose presence brings the bouillabaisse of anxiety, mistrust, and psychosexual tension to a boil. In each of these films, the fun is in seeing how the trio’s sympathies shift unpredictably from one configuration to the next. By 1992’s *Bitter Moon*, yet another even twistier variation of this formula, Polanski’s formerly latent sadomasochistic tendencies had reached near transcendent levels of artistic confession. Though there’s plenty of sex in Polanski’s films, there are no happy couples. *Repulsion*, his first English-language success, bridged the Freudian overtones of Hitchcock’s early ‘60s output (it could have been pitched as “*Marnie* meets *Psycho*”) with the pop art grotesquerie of the Italian giallo films. A few short years later, *Rosemary*’*s Baby*, with its subjective portrait of a demonic conspiracy conceived from within a woman’s own troubled marriage, virtually gave birth to the ‘70s wave of American paranoia thrillers. (Of course, Polanski himself would be responsible for the best of them in *Chinatown*, still the neo-noir par excellence almost half a century hence.) 

Fear and mistrust of one’s neighbors or partners is a central element of *Knife in the Water*, *Repulsion, Cul-de-Sac*, *Rosemary’s Baby*, *What?, The Tenant*, *Tess*, *Bitter Moon*, *Death and the Maiden,* and especially *The Pianist*, which ironically contains some of Polanski’s most darkly comic imagery. Consider the visual joke of Adrien Brody’s lonely, terrified protagonist, a Polish Jew, peeking out of his window to see a German tank pointing its guns directly at him. Polanski often plays on the spectrum between grim and funny, but is rarely successful when he strays too far in either direction. One of the many failed slapstick gags in *Pirates* sees Walter Matthau’s starving captain eagerly lap up spilled oatmeal off the floor. The same gag is recycled as wry tragedy in *The Pianist* when a starving man in the Warsaw ghetto laps up the spilled porridge of an old woman from which he had tried to pry it away. The range of expression in this repetition suggests a connection to lived experience, to the memory of a hardscrabble, poverty-stricken existence that could only have been endured with a humorous spirit.

Throughout his career, Polanski has often used luggage as a clue or link to the past. Long before he memorialized all those abandoned personal belongings on the war-torn streets of Warsaw in *The Pianist*, Polanski depicted cultural displacement as a physical burden in his short film *Two Men and a Wardrobe*, in which two foreigners emerge from the sea lugging a huge wardrobe and are harassed by the local townspeople. Symbolically significant wardrobes, baggage, or items contained therein would go on to appear in *The Tenant*, *Frantic*, *The Ninth Gate*, and *The Ghost Writer* as reminders that the trauma of the past is never really over; it always catches up with us in one way or another.

**SYDNEY POLLACK** (1934–2008)

**FILMS:** 1965—The Slender Thread.  1966—This Property is Condemned.  1968—The Scalphunters.  1969—Castle Keep, They Shoot Horses, Don’t They?  1972—J*eremiah Johnson*.  1973—*The Way We Were*.  1974—The Yakuza.  1975—*Three Days of the Condor*.  1977—Bobby Deerfield.  1979—*The Electric Horseman*.  1981—*Absence of Malice*.  1982—*Tootsie*.  1985—*Out of Africa*.  1990—Havana.  1993—*The Firm*.  1995—Sabrina.  1999—Random Hearts.  2005—The Interpreter, Sketches of Frank Gehry (documentary).  2018—Amazing Grace.

Sydney Pollack is the great chameleon of the New Hollywood cohort. He’s directed at least three classics and a handful of memorable efforts across a range of genres, but his personality remains curiously elusive. The default conclusion that Pollack must be an “actor’s director” isn’t untrue, and yet doesn’t account for his consistently artful sense of decor and tastefully restrained shot making. The frequency with which his players turn in career performances might have something to do with Pollack’s own experience as a prolific character actor. Then again, plenty of competent screen performers have floundered behind the camera, and plenty of directors have failed to cohere the formidable presence of a Robert Redford or Meryl Streep into a sensible whole.

**RIDLEY SCOTT** (1937–	)

**FILMS:** 1977—The Duellists.  1979—*Alien*.  1982—*Blade Runner*.  1985—Legend.  1987—Someone to Watch Over Me.  1989—Black Rain.  1991—*Thelma & Louise*.  1992—1492: Conquest of Paradise. 1996—White Squall.  1997—G.I. Jane.  2000—*Gladiator*.  2001—*Black Hawk Down*, Hannibal.  2003—*Matchstick Men*.  2005—*Kingdom of Heaven*.  2006—A Good Year.  2007—American Gangster.  2008—Body of Lies.  2010—Robin Hood.  2012—*Prometheus*.  2013—*The Counselor*.  2014—Exodus: Gods and Kings.  2015—*The Martian*.  2017—*Alien: Covenant*, All the Money in the World.  2021—The Last Duel, House of Gucci.  2023—Napoleon.

Ridley Scott may not be Hollywood’s greatest artist, but he’s among its greatest showmen. For over four decades, Scott has remained unshakably commercial, the only consistent feature of his wildly diverse filmography. 

Most comfortable with projects set in the ancient past or distant future — they tend to resemble each other in popular movies — Scott is fond of hefty themes like colonialism (*1492, Kingdom of Heaven*), creationism (*Blade Runner*, *Prometheus*), and survivalism (*Alien*, *Thelma & Louise*). Luckily for mainstream audiences, he’s less interested in exploring them with any real depth or nuance than invoking them as superficial clotheslines upon which to hang his evocative visual designs.  

Early in his career, Scott excelled at toeing the line between artful and entertaining. The hypnotic textures of *Alien* and *Blade Runner* would have been disrupted by too much philosophy, but a touch less and they might have come off as mere hokum. Since the early ‘80s, Scott seems to have permanently lost his balance. Despite their epic sparkle and splendor, *Kingdom of Heaven* and *American Gangster* are undermined by sloppy editing and cliche storytelling, while *Prometheus* and *The Counselor* are drowning in sterile abstraction.

For a director who has built his reputation on blockbusters of epic proportions, Scott is too often responsible for films that feel cheaper than their budgets would indicate.    

Scott’s heroes are reluctant yet capable, not eager for confrontation but ennobled by it.

**STEVEN SODERBERGH** (1963–	   )

**FILMS:** 1989—*Sex, Lies, and Videotape*.  1991—Kafka.  1993—King of the Hill.  1995—The Underneath.  1996—Schizopolis, Gray’s Anatomy.  1998—*Out of Sight*.  1999—The Limey.  2000—*Traffic*, *Erin Brockovich*.  2001—*Ocean’s Eleven*.  2002—*Solaris*, Full Frontal.  2004—Ocean’s Twelve.  2005—Bubble.  2006—The Good German.  2007—Ocean’s Thirteen.  2008—Che: Part One (The Argentine), Che: Part Two (Guerrilla).  2009—The Girlfriend Experience, The Informant\!  2011—*Contagion*.  2012—*Magic Mike*, Haywire.  2013—*Side Effects*.  2017—*Logan Lucky*.  2018—Unsane.  2019—*The Laundromat*, High Flying Bird.  2020—Let Them All Talk.  2021—No Sudden Move.

Soderbergh has developed a personal style in spite of himself.  

**PAUL VERHOEVEN** (1938–	       )

**FILMS:** 1971—Business Is Business.  1973—Turkish Delight.  1975—Keetje Tippel.  1977—*Soldier of Orange*.  1980—Spetters.  1983—The Fourth Man.  1985—Flesh and Blood.  1987—*RoboCop*.  1990—*Total Recall*.  1992—*Basic Instinct*.  1995—*Showgirls*.  1997—*Starship Troopers*.  2000—Hollow Man.  2006—*Black Book*.  2012—Tricked (user-generated film).  2016—*Elle*.  2021—Benedetta.
