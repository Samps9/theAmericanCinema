Started his career as the poor man’s Tony Scott; has gradually morphed into the spoiled tween’s James Cameron.  

**MEL BROOKS** (1926–	)

**FILMS:** 1968—*The Producers*.  1970—The Twelve Chairs.  1974—*Blazing Saddles*, *Young Frankenstein*.  1976—Silent Movie.  1977—High Anxiety.  1981—History of the World, Part I.  1987—*Spaceballs*.  1991—Life Stinks.  1993—*Robin Hood: Men in Tights*.  1995–Dracula: Dead and Loving It.

Despite the formidable challenges of David Zucker (*Airplane\!, The Naked Gun*) and Keenan Ivory Wayans (*I’m Gonna Git You Sucka, Scary Movie*), the pioneering send-ups of spoof-master supreme Mel Brooks still represent the peak of the genre.

**TIM BURTON** (1958–		)

**FILMS:** 1985—*Pee-wee’s Big Adventure*.  1988—*Beetlejuice*.  1989—*Batman*.  1990—*Edward Scissorhands*.  1992—Batman Returns.  1994—*Ed Wood*.  1996—*Mars Attacks\!*  1999—*Sleepy Hollow*.  2001—Planet of the Apes.  2003—*Big Fish*.  2005—Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Corpse Bride.  2007—Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.  2010—Alice in Wonderland.  2012—Dark Shadows, Frankenweenie.  2014–Big Eyes.  2016—Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children.  2019–Dumbo.

**JOHN CARPENTER** (1948–	     )

**FILMS:** 1974—Dark Star.  1976—*Assault on Precinct 13*.  1978—*Halloween*.  1980—The Fog.  1981—*Escape from New York*.  1982—*The Thing*.  1983—Christine.  1984—Starman.  1986—*Big Trouble in Little China*.  1987—*Prince of Darkness*.  1988—*They Live*.  1992—Memoirs of an Invisible Man.  1995—*In the Mouth of Madness*.  1995—Village of the Damned.  1996—Escape from L.A.  1998—Vampires.  2001—Ghosts of Mars.  2010—The Ward.

Carpenter’s subversive, DIY sensibilities defined alternative cinema for over a decade. Beginning with 1976’s gritty RIO BRAVO riff ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13, Carpenter established a lean, confrontational style that anticipated the grammar of Stallone and Schwarzenegger’s action extravaganzas.  If the clean-cut yacht rock that dominated mainstream radio in the late '70s and early '80s mirrored the pristine, well-to-do hits of filmmakers like Richard Donner and Steven Spielberg, then Carpenter was punk rock.  The belligerent anti-establishmentarianism of projects like *Escape from New York* and *They Live* was emblematic of the counterculture that sprouted up during the Reagan years.   
The signature vibe of Carpenter's films, with their pulsating synth soundtracks, neon lights, and copious amounts of artificial fog, epitomized a certain style of '80s movie that came to symbolize the era.  His filmography is an analog dreamscape, a cornucopia of glowing monitors and Atari-inflected digital interfaces.  Transportive, thrilling, and a bit deranged, his aesthetic set the template for the plucky retro-futurism of *The Terminator* and *RoboCop*, the goofy artifice of *Gremlins* and *Ghostbusters*, and the eccentric brutality of *The Evil Dead* and *A Nightmare on Elm Street*.  After the blockbuster boom of the late '70s, special effects budgets soared, but Carpenter tended to keep his productions low-down and dirty.  When cinephiles wax nostalgic about the pre-CGI era of practical effects, they’re referring to films like *The Fog* and *The Thing*, fantastical projects that still feel homemade.  (The latter film's titular creature was literally hand-stitched by special effects supervisor Rob Bottin, who was hospitalized with exhaustion by the effort.)    
Carpenter's plots are similarly sparse yet imaginative.  His stories are flexible enough to accommodate a range of heady [socio-political interpretations](https://www.theringer.com/movies/2018/10/4/17933020/they-live-john-carpenter-america-donald-trump), but they also function as simple, unpretentious escapism. His characters are frequently pitted against invasion, possession, mind control, and the apocalypse (fitting for a time when American consumerism reached its zenith).  In his universe, evil is omnipresent but abstract, a specter waiting for the perfect moment to strike.  In his four-star review of *Halloween*, Roger Ebert wrote "we aren’t seeing this movie, we’re having it happen to us.”  Stylish yet economical, *Halloween*'s opening tracking shot is often cited as a masterclass in low-budget suspense, but the ending is equally unsettling: a series of static shots showing empty rooms, dark staircases, silent streets…where might the Boogeyman be lurking next?  
The charm of Carpenter's films lies in their deceptive simplicity.  *Halloween* took the premise of *Jaws*, turned the shark into a maniacal masked killer, and changed horror movies forever.  But even the final sequence of 1984’s *Starman*, the romantic outlier and most expensive film of Carpenter’s career to that point, demonstrates how he could achieve maximum emotional impact with minimal technique.  As Karen Allen’s character bids farewell forever to the alien she’s fallen in love with (obviously the most ‘80s scene imaginable), his spaceship hovers above them, bathing the desert in red light and snow-like precipitation.  The alien’s human form (which strongly resembles Jeff Bridges) wanders into this surreal landscape for a full hypnotic minute as Jack Nietzsche’s ecstatic score pounds away.  We finally cut to a close up of Karen Allen as she watches, her face shrouded in darkness. The screen is filled with bright white light as the camera is raised, tilting down to stay locked on her awestruck reaction.  Without showing much of anything, it gives us everything.    
Carpenter was surpassed in the ‘90s by spiritual successors like Wes Craven and Robert Rodriguez (1998’s sluggish *Vampires* adaptation feels more like a bland rehash of *From Dusk till Dawn* than the hard-hitting neo-western Carpenter envisioned), but even his weakest efforts yield scattered moments of anarchic brilliance.  One can almost picture the twisted smile on Carpenter’s face during the bombastic sequence in *The Village of the Damned* in which the cops, the army, and the FBI (all under the telekinetic influence of eight alien children) blow each other to smithereens.  All in all, *Village* is probably the least effective horror film of Carpenter’s career, and yet it’s still worthy of induction into the “Good Bad Movie Hall of Fame” due to the unintentional(?) comedy of its concluding (triumphantly\!) with Christopher Reeve suicide-bombing a bunch of kids.  
Carpenter may have become a parody of himself by the end of his career (the less said about 2001’s cheesy decapitation-fest *Ghosts of Mars* the better), but the Edgar Wrights and Bong Joon-hos of the world wouldn’t exist without the inspiration of his beautiful dark twisted fantasies.

**WES CRAVEN** (1939–2015)

**FILMS:** 1972—*The Last House on the Left*.  1975—The Fireworks Woman.  1977—*The Hills Have Eyes*.  1981—Deadly Blessing.  1982–Swamp Thing.  1984—*A Nightmare on Elm Street*, The Hills Have Eyes Part II.  1986—Deadly Friend.  1988—The Serpent and the Rainbow.  1989—Shocker.  1991—The People Under the Stairs.  1994—*Wes Craven’s New Nightmare*.  1995—Vampire in Brooklyn.  1996—*Scream*.  1997—*Scream 2*.  1999—Music of the Heart.  2000—Scream 3\.  2005—*Red Eye*, Cursed.  2010—My Soul to Take.  2011—*Scream 4*.

Before revitalizing the horror genre with a postmodern twist in the ‘90s, Craven bridged the treacherous gap from ‘70s grindhouse brutality (*Last House on the Left)* to ‘80s gross-out whimsicality (*Nightmare on Elm Street*). Craven’s movies are heavy on home invasion (or, in Freddy Krueger’s case, mind invasion). Despite a slew of poorly received projects post-*Elm Street*, time has redeemed aspects of even Craven’s schlockiest efforts. Half-baked as they are, critics have already begun reappraising *Serpent and the Rainbow* and *People Under the Stairs* for their earnest commitment to representation at a time when it wasn’t exactly fashionable. Craven doesn’t get enough credit for the depth and complexity of *New Nightmare* in particular, undoubtedly his most personal film. Beneath its cheeky metatext re: the business behind horror sequels is a potent hereditary allegory about the fear of passing a mental illness or pathology along to a child. But beneath even *that* is a heartfelt argument for the necessity and tradition of using stories (fairy tales, horror movies) to process darkness, trauma, and evil. This deepest layer is Craven’s raison d’etre, the ultimate justification for a career spent plumbing the depths of fear, both his and ours.   

   
**JOE DANTE** (1946–	     )

**FILMS:** 1976—Hollywood Boulevard (w/ Allan Arkush).  1978—*Piranha*.  1979—Rock ‘n’ Roll High School.  1981—*The Howling*.  1983—Twilight Zone: The Movie (Segment: “It’s a Good Life”).  1984—*Gremlins*.  1985—Explorers.  1987—*Innerspace*, Amazon Women on the Moon (six segments).  1989—*The ‘Burbs*.  1990—*Gremlins 2: The New Batch*.  1993—Matinee.  1998—*Small Soldiers*.  2003—Looney Tunes: Back in Action.  2006—Trapped Ashes (Segment: “Wraparound”).  2009—The Hole.  2014—Burying the Ex.  2018—Nightmare Cinema (Segment: “Mirare”).

Quintessential ‘80s mise-en-scene; often praised for his macabre sense of humor (which I wouldn’t call “dark” as much as “dim,” but it’s better than none at all). 

**GUILLERMO DEL TORO** (1964–	)

**FILMS:** 1993—Cronos.  1997—Mimic.  2001—*The Devil’s Backbone*.  2002—Blade II.  2004—*Hellboy*.  2006—*Pan’s Labyrinth*.  2008—Hellboy II: The Golden Army.  2013—*Pacific Rim*.  2015—Crimson Peak.  2017—*The Shape of Water*.  2021—Pinocchio, Nightmare Alley.

**PETER & BOBBY FARRELLY** (1956–	), (1958–	)

**FILMS:** 1994—*Dumb and Dumber*.  1996—*Kingpin*.  1998—*There’s Something About Mary*.  2000—*Me, Myself & Irene*.  2001—*Shallow Hal*, Osmosis Jones (live-action sequences).  2003—Stuck on You.  2005—Fever Pitch.  2007—The Heartbreak Kid.  2011—Hall Pass.  2012—The Three Stooges.  2013—Movie 43 (three segments).  2014—Dumb and Dumber To.  2018—*Green Book*.

A likable road movie is always a formula for popular success, and the Farrellys’ goofy, accessible approach to the genre has, for better or worse, made the duo an American staple.  Their sense of humor isn’t ironic or obscure, but earnest and child-like. They appreciate the raw comedic power of a penis in a zipper. They’re not above a semen hair gel joke. Like a big, friendly St. Bernard, they do have a tendency to slobber, but it generally comes from a place of affection. They make flawed, good-hearted movies about flawed people with good hearts, and it usually works because they’re funny and relatable.  

**AMY HECKERLING** (1954–	    )

**FILMS:** 1982—*Fast Times at Ridgemont High*.  1984—Johnny Dangerously.  1985—*National Lampoon’s European Vacation*.  1989—*Look Who’s Talking*.  1990—Look Who’s Talking Too.  1995—*Clueless*.  2000—Loser.  2007—I Could Never Be Your Woman.  2012—Vamps.  2020—Royalties S1 (ten episodes).

**WALTER HILL** (1942–	)

**FILMS:** 1975—*Hard Times*.  1978—*The Driver*.  1979—*The Warriors*.  1980—The Long Riders.  1981—Southern Comfort.  1982—*48 Hrs.*  1984—*Streets of Fire*.  1985—Brewster’s Millions.  1986—Crossroads.  1987—*Extreme Prejudice*.  1988—Red Heat.  1989—Johnny Handsome.  1990—Another 48 Hrs.  1992—Trespass.  1993—Geronimo: An American Legend.  1995—Wild Bill.  1996—Last Man Standing.  2000—Supernova (as “Thomas Lee”).  2002—*Undisputed*.  2012—Bullet to the Head.  2016—The Assignment.  2022—Dead for a Dollar.

One of Hollywood’s unsung journeymen, Hill began as a formidable writer/director of no-nonsense neo-westerns, evolved into one of the signature action filmmakers of the ‘80s, underwent a commercial decline in ‘90s (with *Supernova* as the nadir), and has finally reinvented himself as a reliable gun-for-hire on prestige TV projects and what The Ringer might refer to as “garbage crime” movies. Late-period thrillers like *Bullet to the Head* and *The Assignment* are somewhere between VOD schlock and ‘70s grindhouse revivalism, and there’s something admirable in Hill’s anachronistic commitment to a style of genre filmmaking typically reserved for the secondhand streaming service circuit.

**JOHN HUGHES** (1950–2009)

**FILMS:** 1984—*Sixteen Candles*.  1985—*The Breakfast Club*, *Weird Science*.  1986—*Ferris Bueller’s Day Off*.  1987—*Planes, Trains and Automobiles*.  1988—She’s Having a Baby.  1989—Uncle Buck.  1991—Curly Sue.

**JOHN LANDIS** (1950–	)

**FILMS:** 1973—Schlock.  1977—*The Kentucky Fried Movie*.  1978—*Animal House*.  1980—*The Blues Brothers*.  1981—*An American Werewolf in London*.  1982—Coming Soon.  1983—*Trading Places*, Twilight Zone: The Movie (two segments).  1985—Spies Like Us, Into the Night.  1986—*Three Amigos*.  1987—Amazon Women on the Moon (four segments).  1988—*Coming to America*.  1991—Oscar.  1992—Innocent Blood.  1994—Beverly Hills Cop III.  1996—The Stupids.  1998—Blues Brothers 2000, Susan’s Plan.  2010—Burke and Hare.

**DOUG LIMAN** (1965–		)

**FILMS:** 1994—Getting In.  1996—*Swingers*.  1999—*Go*.  2002—*The Bourne Identity*.  2005—*Mr. & Mrs. Smith*.  2008—Jumper.  2010—Fair Game.  2014—*Edge of Tomorrow*.  2017—American Made, The Wall.  2021—Chaos Walking, Lockdown.

**SAM RAIMI** (1959–	)

**FILMS:** 1977—It’s Murder\!  1981—*The Evil Dead*.  1985—Crimewave.  1987—*Evil Dead II*.  1990—Darkman.  1992—*Army of Darkness*.  1995—The Quick and the Dead.  1998—A Simple Plan.  1999—For Love of the Game.  2000—The Gift.  2002—*Spider-Man*.  2004—*Spider-Man 2*.  2007—Spider-Man 3\.  2009—*Drag Me to Hell*.  2013—Oz the Great and Powerful.  2022—Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.

If Sam Raimi’s sequels tend to outshine their brilliant predecessors, his career has followed suit. He somehow outdid his first act as the patron saint of 1980s DIY genre filmmaking with a second life shepherding the Tobey Maguire *Spider-Man* films to frighteningly influential heights. Just as *Evil Dead II* improves on the original’s tonal exchange between the comic and manic, *Spider-Man 2* transcends mere comic book mania to emerge as still the best superhero movie to date. Raimi doesn’t re-invent the wheel thematically, but his snicklefritz spirit animates the hero’s journey in *Looney Tunes* technicolor. Each franchise’s third edition succumbs to camp in ways too divisive to approach consensus. Suffice it to say, neither *Army of Darkness* nor *Spider-Man 3* will ever be classified as the height of their respective trilogies. Unfortunately, the same goes for Raimi’s latest incarnation as a pawn in Marvel’s ongoing bid for world domination. Aside from a precarious *For Love of the Game*\-sized interlude when he seemed on the verge of receding into hired hackdom, Raimi has nonetheless managed to preserve his commitment to stylistic idiosyncrasy even as the superhero movie economy he helped build grows increasingly airless. 

**HAROLD RAMIS** (1944–2014)

**FILMS:** 1980—*Caddyshack*.  1983—*National Lampoon’s Vacation*.  1986—Club Paradise.  1993—*Groundhog Day*.  1995—Stuart Saves His Family.  1996—Multiplicity.  1999—*Analyze This*.  2000—Bedazzled.  2002—Analyze That.  2005—The Ice Harvest.  2009—Year One.

From his first job helming CADDYSHACK, Ramis mastered a kind of comic understatement perfectly suited to the electricity of his players. The locations aren’t fancy, but they’re culturally specific. The camerawork isn’t flashy or overly formal, but it does what it needs to. Ramis doesn’t try to bang you over the head with the humor of the premise. GROUNDHOG DAY remains the crowning achievement of both Ramis’ and Bill Murray’s illustrious careers, which makes it all the more regrettable that their relationship fell apart over it.

**IVAN REITMAN** (1946–	)

**FILMS:** 1971—Foxy Lady.  1973—Cannibal Girls.  1979—*Meatballs*.  1981—*Stripes*.  1984—*Ghostbusters*.  1986—Legal Eagles.  1988—Twins.  1989—*Ghostbusters II*.  1990—*Kindergarten Cop*.  1993—*Dave*.  1994—Junior.  1997—Fathers’ Day.  1998—Six Days, Seven Nights.  2001—Evolution.  2004—Cooking Lessons (TV film).  2006—My Super Ex-Girlfriend.  2011—No Strings Attached.  2014—Draft Day.  

Earnest, full-hearted director with more grace than his genre usually allows.  Late career misses aside, GHOSTBUSTERS and DAVE are superb time-capsules of a simpler era of American filmgoing when the stakes for a mainstream movie didn’t feel so high even though audiences were ten times larger. 

   
**JASON REITMAN** (1977–	)

**FILMS:** 2005—Thank You for Smoking.  2007—*Juno*.  2009—*Up in the Air*.  2011—*Young Adult*.  2013—Labor Day.  2014—Men, Women & Children.  2018—*Tully*, The Front Runner.  2021—Ghostbusters: Afterlife.

**MICHAEL RITCHIE** (1931–2001)

**FILMS:** 1969—*Downhill Racer*.  1972—*The Candidate*, Prime Cut.  1975—*Smile*.  1976—*The Bad News Bears*.  1977—Semi-Tough.  1979—An Almost Perfect Affair.  1980—The Island, Divine Madness (concert film).  1981—Student Bodies (uncredited w/ Mickey Rose).  1983—The Survivors.  1985—*Fletch*.  1986—The Golden Child, Wildcats.  1988—The Couch Trip.  1989—Fletch Lives.  1992—Diggstown.  1994—Cops & Robbersons, The Scout.  1995—The Fantasticks.  1997—A Simple Wish.

Michael Ritchie’s sterling career has gone largely unsung thanks to a stylistic predilection for wry understatement. A talented all-rounder with a documentarian’s eye, Ritchie’s movies are closely observed and tightly paced, but he’s loose with his actors and allows them to impress themselves on the material in ways that reflect his own cockeyed perspective. Make no mistake: Robert Redford’s character in *Downhill Racer* is every bit the director surrogate that Walter Matthau’s is in *The Bad News Bears*. The same goes for Lee Marvin in *Prime Cut* and even Chevy Chase in *Fletch*. Like most great auteurs of the New Hollywood, Ritchie identifies with difficult male loners. His protagonists are magnetic but misanthropic and self-absorbed, dreamers too disillusioned to take even their own dreams seriously. 

**ROBERT RODRIGUEZ** (1968–	)

**FILMS:** 1992—*El Mariachi*.  1995—*Desperado*, Four Rooms (Segment: “The Misbehavers”).  1996—*From Dusk Till Dawn*.  1998—*The Faculty*.  2001—*Spy Kids*.  2002—Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams.  2003—*Once Upon a Time in Mexico*, Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over.  2005—*Sin City* (w/ Frank Miller).  2007—Planet Terror.  2009—Shorts.  2010—Machete.  2011—Spy Kids: All the Time in the World.  2013—Machete Kills.  2014—Sin City: A Dame to Kill For.  2019—*Alita: Battle Angel*, Red 11\.  2020—We Can Be Heroes.  

**HERBERT ROSS** (1927—2001)

**FILMS:** 1969—*Goodbye, Mr. Chips*.  1970—The Owl and the Pussycat.  1971—T.R. Baskin.  1972—Play It Again, Sam.  1973—The Last of Sheila.  1975—*The Sunshine Boys*.  1975—*Funny Lady*.  1976—*The Seven Per-Cent Solution*.  1977—*The Turning Point,* The Goodbye Girl, Chapter Two.  1978—*California Suite*.  1980—Nijinsky.  1981—*Pennies From Heaven*.  1982—I Ought to Be in Pictures.  1983—Max Dugan Returns.  1984—*Footloose*, Protocol.  1987—The Secret of My Success, Dancers.  1989—*Steel Magnolias*.  1990—My Blue Heaven.  1991—True Colors.  1993—Undercover Blues.  1995—Boys on the Side.

**GEORGE ROY HILL** (1921—2002)

**FILMS:** 1962—Period of Adjustment.  1963—Toys in the Attic.  1964—The World of Henry Orient.  1966—Hawaii.  1967—Thoroughly Modern Millie.  1969—*Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid*.  1972—Slaughterhouse-Five.  1973—*The Sting*.  1975—*The Great Waldo Pepper*.  1977—*Slap Shot.*  1979—A Little Romance.  1982—*The World According to Garp*.  1984—The Little Drummer Girl.  1988—*Funny Farm*.

The swaggering charisma of George Roy Hill’s glory years saw the New Hollywood at its most wistful. As Roger Avary and Quentin Tarantino have astutely noted, Hill’s heroes are all variations of Hill himself: dreamers, schemers, or con men who busy themselves by turning their lies into reality. Hill gave Paul Newman and Robert Redford some of their best moments together and apart, with the latter’s performance in *The Great Waldo Pepper* paving the way for Tom Cruise’s cocksure screen persona (not to mention the *Top Gun* movies’ sky-bound wizardry).

**FRANKLIN J. SCHAFFNER** (1920–1989)

**FILMS:** 1952—The Wings of the Dove.  1963—The Stripper.  1964—*The Best Man*.  1965—*The War Lord*.  1967—The Double Man.  1968—*Planet of the Apes*.  1970—*Patton*.  1971—Nicholas and Alexandra.  1973—*Papillon*.  1976—Islands in the Stream.  1978—*The Boys from Brazil*.  1981—Sphinx.  1982—Yes, Giorgio.  1987—Lionheart.  1989—Welcome Home.
