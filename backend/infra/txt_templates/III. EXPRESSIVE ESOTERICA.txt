EXPRESSIVE ESOTERICA (22): 
“These are the unsung directors with difficult styles or unfashionable genres or both. Their deeper virtues are often obscured by irritating idiosyncrasies on the surface, but they are generally redeemed by their seriousness and grace.”




PAUL THOMAS ANDERSON (1970–        )


FILMS:  1996—Hard Eight.  1997—Boogie Nights.  1999—Magnolia.  2002—Punch-Drunk Love.  2007—There Will Be Blood.  2012—The Master.  2015—Junun (documentary).  2014—Inherent Vice.  2017—Phantom Thread.  2019—Anima (w/ Thom Yorke).  2021—Licorice Pizza.




In PTA’s films, parody and melodrama are nested within each other so intimately as to be nearly indistinguishable. He has a knack for comedy that leaves the audience unsure if they’re supposed to laugh. To this end, he might be pegged as a descendant of Altman, but his spiritual predecessor is Orson Welles. Besides the similarity of their wunderkind origin stories, they share a grandiosity of technique and attitude, even in self-consciously “smaller” projects.  
        Boogie Nights, maybe Anderson’s most popular film, is also his most overrated, a bloated Scorsese imitation that nevertheless manages several comedic moments of proto-Apatowian inspiration amidst its overtaxed histrionics.  PTA’s peculiar mix of pathos and reverie wouldn’t fully cohere until 2001’s brilliant Punch-Drunk Love (conversely his least popular and yet most personally expressive film).  However, nothing in his previous material prepared critics and audiences for the Biblical revelations of There Will Be Blood, still frequently mentioned as perhaps the best American film of the century.  Ever eager to outdo himself, he doubled down with The Master, a movie so laborious and elliptical it lost sight of its own purpose.  At bottom, PTA is most concerned with the Limits of Human Intimacy.  As in, how scary and exhilarating and ecstatic and tragic things can get when we let someone all the way in.  And the dual sense of desire and repulsion associated with letting other people get close to us.  And the ways we can hurt ourselves and others when they get too close.  He’s artsy, humane, pretentious, and afflicted.  The kind of film artist every white Brooklyn/LA-based hipster aspires to be: a prodigal writer/director with extraordinary talent and taste who tackles the Grand Themes with sly humor and deep feeling. 
The movies themselves are extravagant yet tightly wound.  He’s preoccupied with broken people struggling towards functionality, or inventing some version of their own.  His voice is eccentric and conspiratorial, but never alienating.  Instead, he lets us in on the conspiracy, then lets us decide what to make of it.  PTA’s plots tend to revolve around intense relationships between two opposing psychological forces (lovers, rivals, mentors, etc.).  In There Will Be Blood, The Master, and Phantom Thread, the protagonists and their foils circle each other like dogs bound to fall in love and/or fight to the death.  He has a wonderful eye for performance, and it’s no coincidence he’s gotten career-best work from both masters of their craft (Daniel-Day Lewis) and talented amateurs (Mark Wahlberg and Vicky Krieps).  Also of note is his superior taste and instincts re: the use of music.  Only Scorsese and Tarantino match his ability to drop the needle on an iconic (or soon-to-be-made-iconic) rock, pop, or R&B single with as much savvy and style.  He has an uncanny ability to conjure a mystical tension from thin air, leaving most of the heavy lifting to his actors and wonderful array of musical collaborators (most notably Aimee Mann, Jon Brion, and Jonny Greenwood
Like Phantom Thread, Punch-Drunk Love, and even the Master, Licorice Pizza is about being at war with the person you love, aside from its “all men are operators” theme, it recreates a time and a place that has come into vogue as Gen X ages into its wistful golden years. Still, there’s a hollowness to the emotional center of the movie that can be traced to the vacant presence of Cooper Hoffman rather than PTA’s exquisite direction.


WES ANDERSON (1969–        )


FILMS: 1996—Bottle Rocket.  1998—Rushmore.  2001—The Royal Tenenbaums.  2004—The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou.  2007—The Darjeeling Limited.  2009—Fantastic Mr. Fox.  2012—Moonrise Kingdom.  2014—The Grand Budapest Hotel.  2018—Isle of Dogs.  2021—The French Dispatch.  2023—Asteroid City, The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar, The Rat Catcher, Poison, The Swan.


Wes Anderson’s pop-up picturebook style might be too precious for some, but it’s unique in the annals of modern cinema. His career arc resembles a reverse bell curve: the charming idiosyncrasies of Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums gave way to the indulgent bells and whistles of The Life Aquatic and The Darjeeling Limited which gave way to the symphonic harmony of Moonrise Kingdom and The Grand Budapest Hotel. His cosmopolitan obsessions belie a distinctively middle American sense of droll humor and deadpan sentimentality. Detractors perceive his movies as lacking an emotional core because they’re more concerned with design than story or character.


NOAH BAUMBACH (1969–        )


FILMS: 1995—Kicking and Screaming.  1997—Highball, Mr. Jealousy.  2005—The Squid and the Whale.  2007—Margot at the Wedding.  2010—Greenberg.  2013—Frances Ha.  2014—While We’re Young.  2015—Mistress America, De Palma (documentary w/ Jake Paltrow).  2017—The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected).  2019—Marriage Story.


At his best, Noah Baumbach rubs shoulders with Woody Allen and Whit Stillman in the Self-Obsessed Manhattanite Hall of Fame. His neurotic psychology samples both Allen’s comic autobiography and Stillman’s mannered sociology, but retains a grubby hipster charm all its own.

David Cronenberg is like John Carpenter’s artsy-fartsy older brother. They’re both skeptical of authority and preoccupied with a certain conservative dread. But Cronenberg is more soulful than satirical, taking his characters’ bizarre (and frequently supernatural) justifications for politically motivated violence at face value. Parallels between The Dead Zone and the cases of Squeaky Fromme and John Hinckley, Jr. have only gotten more potent in this political climate, especially given Donald Trump’s resemblance to populist blowhard Greg Stillson.


Despite their slow pace and short running times, Cronenberg’s movies are densely packed with Baconian imagery and Freudian psychology. The amniotic configurations of Rabid and The Brood are on par with H.R. Giger’s embryonic Alien designs. Videodrome, meanwhile, bears thematic similarities to Infinite Jest, no less portentous a comment on the psychological power of our viewing choices. 


  
JOHNATHAN DEMME (1944–2017)

Demme has used his trademark medium close up, with the actor looking straight into the camera in surprisingly versatile ways.

Spike Lee has been pigeonholed—not unintentionally— as the poet laureate of black America ever since Do the Right Thing, still the most impactful American film about race ever made. But his achievements in one ballpark shouldn’t trivialize his ability in others. Lee works in every genre, always pursuing a kaleidoscopic vision of American nationalism. His second best film is probably 25th Hour, a drama about an Irish-American drug dealer reckoning with his friends and family on the eve of a prison sentence. His third best might be Inside Man, a kind of heist movie in reverse that offers the finest portrait of post-9/11 New York City this side of 30 Rock.


Lee doesn’t like to subvert cliches so much as recontextualize them. Black people are at the forefront of his movies, but he never chooses obvious signifiers of blackness. You’ll rarely hear non-diegetic hip-hop on a Spike Lee soundtrack, even (especially?) in contexts when it might be artistically defensible. Bill Simmons notarized his new school honkyism when he complained on a podcast about how Lee avoided using hip-hop in favor of Aaron Copland’s classic orchestral compositions in He Got Game. Of course, Simmons is too much of a philistine to understand that Lee was deliberately forgoing a stereotypical association to instead connect basketball, a predominately black sport, to America’s pioneer spirit. Lee frequently places his black characters in settings associated with traditional visions of White America, like the forests of Colorado in BlacKkKlansman. Decisions like these challenged us to expand our definition of  Americana to include black faces and culture long before wokeness came into vogue.  


Lee is undoubtedly a talented stylist, but he’s never been rewarded in proportion to his stature among cinephiles because, frankly, he’s made more great sequences than great films. Even his best work can be shaggy or overly didactic. Yet even his worst pulses with political urgency and visual creativity. As with Altman, the whole of Lee’s career is greater than the sum of its parts. They’re cut from the same cloth, the kind of directors who will always be cursed to eternal relegation in silly rankings like these because of the same tendency that makes them original.  They’re both ruled by their unruliness, by their incorrigible Brechtian instinct to shake you up. For better and worse, Spike Lee makes a lot of choices. At his best, those choices lead to thrilling moments where the traditional boundaries of narrative fall away and the true stakes are laid bare in sobering fashion.

If De Palma is the John Ford of erotic thrillers, Lyne is their Howard Hawks. 




PAUL MAZURSKY (1930–2014)


FILMS: 1969—Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice.  1970—Alex in Wonderland.  1973—Blume in Love.  1974—Harry and Tonto.  1976—Next Stop, Greenwich Village.  1978—An Unmarried Woman.  1980—Willie & Phil.  1982—Tempest.  1984—Moscow on the Hudson.  1986—Down and Out in Beverly Hills.  1988—Moon over Parador.  1989—Enemies, A Love Story.  1991—Scenes from a Mall.  1993—The Pickle.  1996—Faithful.  2006—Yippee (documentary).


No writer/director explored the twisted psychological consequences of the sexual revolution with as much nuance and dexterity as Mazursky. In Blume in Love, the titular character’s behavior is clearly reprehensible from the start and only grows worse. But he’s never depicted as an outright evil man. Blume genuinely cares about his ex-wife, and he wants her to be happy. And yet... “You’re a sick man,” she tells him as he forces himself on her. That he surely is, and love is his disease. 


 
ALEXANDER PAYNE (1961–                   )


FILMS: 1996—Citizen Ruth.  1999—Election.  2002—About Schmidt.  2004—Sideways.  2011—The Descendants.  2013—Nebraska.  2017—Downsizing.  2023—The Holdovers.


Payne explores middle aged suburban ennui in fairly naked narrative contexts. His protagonists are always white men who are well-off, aging, and cosmically dissatisfied. The tone he strikes is harsh but honest, comical yet emotionally sensitive. Writer-directors of his type are increasingly old fashioned in an era when filmmakers are expected to couch their ideas in the corners of more commercially appealing genre or franchise fare. Election is probably still Payne’s most enduring film, though intelligent tragicomedies like Sideways and Downsizing have proven he’s more than a one-hit wonder.

FILMS: 1978—Blue Collar.  1979—Hardcore.  1980—American Gigolo.  1982—Cat People.  1985—Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters.  1987—Light of Day.  1988—Patty Hearst.  1990—The Comfort of Strangers.  1992—Light Sleeper.  1994—Witch Hunt (TV film).  1996—City Hall.  1997—Affliction, Touch.  1999—Forever Mine.  2002—Auto Focus.  2005—Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist.  2007—The Walker.  2008—Adam Resurrected.  2013—The Canyons.  2014—The Dying of the Light.  2016—Dog Eat Dog.  2017—First Reformed.  2021—The Card Counter.


Paul Schrader is the grand Poobah of tragic male repression and depravity. Besides his impressive body of work behind the camera, Schrader’s screenplays have resulted in career highlights for Scorsese, De Palma, John Flynn, and Peter Weir. His collaborations with Scorsese in particular (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, The Last Temptation of Christ, and Bringing Out the Dead) have yielded iconic results, with each artist elevating the other in that marvelous symbiotic way only the cinema allows. His later films exhibit a skillful sense of surrealism within a grounded framework. He calls it “transcendental” cinema. Herzog calls it the “ecstatic truth”...when a film achieves something beyond character or plot development, ignoring narrative logic altogether to grasp at the sublime.  




TONY SCOTT (1944–2012)


FILMS: 1983—The Hunger.  1986—Top Gun.  1987—Beverly Hills Cop II.  1990—Days of Thunder, Revenge.  1991—The Last Boy Scout.  1993—True Romance.  1995—Crimson Tide.  1996—The Fan.  1998—Enemy of the State.  2001—Spy Game.  2004—Man on Fire.  2005—Domino.  2006—Deja Vu.  2009—The Taking of Pelham 123.  2010—Unstoppable.


Tony Scott’s flamboyant visual style (which Quentin Tarantino has likened to mosaic) and masculine sensibilities belie a surprisingly vulnerable personality. There’s darkness in the hearts of even his noblest characters and fragility in even his most ruthless. He prefers macho environments like the military and pro sports, where the seeds of rivalry and fraternity are sown. But as opposed to, say Howard Hawks, Scott deals in the expression rather than repression of emotion. Try as they might to outrun or ignore their demons, Scott’s headstrong heroes learn they must battle through them to solve the matter at hand.


His plots are never particularly sophisticated, but their subtexts are rich in socio-political associations. Besides the Cold War contexts of Top Gun and Spy Game, Man on Fire evokes the bloodthirsty catharsis of the Iraq War and the capture of Saddam Hussein. John Travolta’s raving financier in The Taking of Pelham 123 echoes the villainy behind the 2008 economic recession. Beginning with Enemy of the State, Scott adopted surveillance as both a theme and visual device. This aesthetic fully blossomed in the wake of 9/11 with the schizophrenic editing and contrived gadgetry of Domino and Deja Vu.  He also gravitated more and more towards the bureaucratic frustrations of collaboration. Consider the diplomacy and gamesmanship at play in the computer monitor-jammed command centers of Crimson Tide, Enemy of the State, Spy Game, Deja Vu, The Taking of Pelham 123, and Unstoppable.  


But Scott’s great hidden motif is racial friction in professional settings. Clear examples can be found lurking beneath the surface of Crimson Tide and Deja Vu. The former is hardly subtle in its coded confrontations between Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington. The latter lends an unspoken edge to the dynamic between Washington’s ATF agent and his white coworkers. Note the squabbling investigators’ discomfort when Washington first enters their circle. Of course, within thirty seconds he’s made friendly introductions, cracked the case, and gone for a coffee break. They’re embarrassed to realize he’s the most competent guy in the room, but they’re doubly flummoxed because he’s also the most pleasant. Enemy of the State, for its part, also draws an implicit line from government-sponsored invasion of privacy to racial profiling and prejudicial police search and seizure practices.


However, politics are never the point of a Tony Scott film, and he respects his audience too much to deliver a dissertation. In keeping with the traditions of classic Hollywood, his best work communicates a simple, heartfelt message in a human way. For all their bombast and bluster, Top Gun and Days of Thunder are exquisite ruminations on pride and fear. Spy Game and Man on Fire are about the importance of human tenderness in a world of brutality. And Unstoppable, the strongest (and least political) of Scott’s late-period thrillers, is a powerful allegory about fixing one’s mistakes before they derail one’s life, an especially poignant reminder in light of Scott’s untimely death.  


Aspects of Scott’s shallow commercialism have aged badly, but not as badly as the prudish condescension of his detractors. Their frequent refrain of “all style, no substance” is as facile as it is disingenuous. Any critic worth his salt knows that, at a certain level of artistry, style is its own form of substance.




PETER WEIR (1944–                )


FILMS: 1971—Homesdale.  1974—The Cars That Ate Paris.  1975—Picnic at Hanging Rock.  1977—The Last Wave.  1981—Gallipoli.  1982—The Year of Living Dangerously.  1985—Witness.  1986—The Mosquito Coast.  1989—Dead Poets Society.  1990—Green Card.  1993—Fearless.  1998—The Truman Show.  2003—Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World.  2010—The Way Back.


The Australian counterpart to Ang Lee, Weir explores the space between one’s feelings and the context of their surroundings. His characters occupy worlds where strict codes of conduct and social mores prevent direct emotional confrontation. This prerogative often takes him into the past, but philosophical tangents like Dead Poets Society, Fearless, and The Truman Show have proven his range over time. His favorite motif is water; his movies frequently evoke sexual tension through rain and moisture. Is it any wonder he started in the desert and wound up at sea? His late career masterpiece Master and Commander is simply the finest film of its kind (Georgian-era naval fiction), from any era.
        However, like every director in this category he’s not without his awkward moments.  Despite his insistence on the contrary, Weir’s films must be appreciated more for their surfaces than their depths. Weir aspires to anthropology, but his movies are more like dioramas than documentaries. He’s unusually delicate in his depiction of foreign environments, and yet his painterly instincts are often at odds with the self-satisfied social messaging of his material. The romantic atmosphere and sublime craftsmanship of Witness and The Year of Living Dangerously don’t excuse their cringey sense of cultural caricature. Weir’s personality can be summed up by a scene in the latter during which Linda Hunt’s Billy Kwan (a casting choice that is in itself a condemnation) peeks in on a poor Indonesian family preparing their nude, deceased son for burial. Hunt-as-Kwan watches this quietly tragic yet beautiful ceremony unfold before solemnly backing out of their dwelling, head bowed. It’s a powerful sequence in a vacuum, but the viewer can’t help but ask: why is Hunt barging in on this family at such a moment in the first place? 




ROBERT ZEMECKIS (1952–                )


FILMS: 1978—I Wanna Hold Your Hand.  1980—Used Cars.  1984—Romancing the Stone.  1985—Back to the Future.  1988—Who Framed Roger Rabbit.  1989—Back to the Future Part II.  1990—Back to the Future Part III.  1992—Death Becomes Her.  1994—Forrest Gump.  1997—Contact.  2000—Cast Away, What Lies Beneath.  2004—The Polar Express.  2007—Beowulf.  2009—A Christmas Carol.  2012—Flight.  2015—The Walk.  2016—Allied.  2018—Welcome to Marwen.  2020—The Witches.


Zemeckis has been characterized as the Salieri to Spielberg’s Mozart so many times it’s become cliche, but when you examine their careers side-by-side, that analogy seems more charitable than pejorative.  Despite their beloved place in the cultural memory, none of his films have aged particularly well except Roger Rabbit and his (initially-reviled) adaptations of The Polar Express, A Christmas Carol, and Beowulf.
