LESS THAN MEETS THE EYE (11): 
“These are the directors with reputations in excess of inspirations. In retrospect, it always seems that the personal signatures to their films were written with invisible ink.”




RICHARD ATTENBOROUGH (1923–2014)


FILMS: 1969—Oh! What a Lovely War.  1972—Young Winston.  1977—A Bridge Too Far.  1978—Magic.  1982—Gandhi.  1987—Cry Freedom.  1992—Chaplin.  1993—Shadowlands.  1996—In Love and War.  1999—Grey Owl.  2007—Closing the Ring.


JAMES CAMERON (1954–           )


FILMS: 1982—Piranha II: The Spawning.  1984—The Terminator.  1986—Aliens.  1989—The Abyss.  1991—Terminator 2: Judgment Day.  1994—True Lies.  1997—Titanic.  2003—Ghosts of the Abyss (documentary).  2005—Aliens of the Deep (documentary).  2009—Avatar.  2022—Avatar: The Way of Water.


It took longer than some of us expected, but after over a decade of work on an AVATAR sequel that has yet to materialize, it appears James Cameron has finally disappeared completely up his own ass. By all accounts, misery is Cameron’s metier. He’s notoriously difficult to work for. His actors talk about him with either outright disdain or conspicuous diplomacy.  THE ABYSS, far from his best film, is still perhaps the clearest lens into Cameron’s belligerent persona, specifically the sequence in which Ed Harris’ character furiously beats and berates his wife’s lifeless body when she won’t respond to resuscitation as the rest of his crew looks on in discomfort.  
It’s probably too late to convince cineastes that ALIENS is overrated, but with overwrought misses like THE ABYSS and AVATAR one no longer encounters enough resistance to make the point worth arguing.  Cameron is Paul Verhoeven without a sense of humor. He’s Ridley Scott without the strength of his convictions. He’s Michael Bay without the childish joy. THE TERMINATOR is admittedly close to perfect, and TITANIC represents for some the peak of popular American filmmaking, but despite extraordinary storytelling ability Cameron’s true identity is more super producer than auteur director. If you strain your eyes, a motif of hubris runs through his films, in both plot and production. Perhaps this is the fundamental feature of his personality, which is strong enough to will new technologies into being for the purpose of bringing life to his creations, but not imaginative enough to imbue those creations with anything more than self-satisfaction at having created them against all odds.  




SOFIA COPPOLA (1971–        )


FILMS: 1999—The Virgin Suicides.  2003—Lost in Translation.  2006—Marie Antoinette.  2010—Somewhere.  2013—The Bling Ring.  2015—A Very Murray Christmas.  2017—The Beguiled.  2020—On the Rocks.  2023—Priscilla.


Sofia Coppola’s filmmaking is like a delicate blossom: beautiful, but a stiff breeze will blow it away. 




RICHARD DONNER (1930–             )


FILMS: 1961—X-15.  1968—Salt and Pepper.  1969—Lola.  1976—The Omen.  1978—Superman.  1980—Inside Moves.  1982—The Toy.  1985—The Goonies, Ladyhawke.  1987—Lethal Weapon.  1988—Scrooged.  1989—Lethal Weapon 2.  1992—Lethal Weapon 3, Radio Flyer.  1994—Maverick.  1995—Assassins.  1997—Conspiracy Theory.  1998—Lethal Weapon 4.  2003—Timeline.  2006—16 Blocks.


The back to back successes of The Omen and Superman allowed Richard Donner to have the kind of career he probably didn’t deserve, bouncing giddily between mega-budgeted franchise properties and outlandish genre goofs with equally tasteless aplomb. The Goonies is destined to live on for generations as the 1980s’ most overrated “classic,” while the Lethal Weapon films endure despite Donner’s clumsy grasp on the wheel thanks to the charisma of Gibson and Glover. Bill Murray summed up Donner’s directorial voice with an anecdote from his time on the set of Scrooged: “He kept telling me to do things louder, louder, louder. I think he was deaf.”




RON HOWARD (1954–        )


FILMS: 1977—Grand Theft Auto.  1982—Night Shift.  1984—Splash.  1985—Cocoon.  1986—Gung Ho.  1988—Willow.  1989—Parenthood.  1991—Backdraft.  1992—Far and Away.  1994—The Paper.  1995—Apollo 13.  1996—Ransom.  1999—EDtv.  2000—How the Grinch Stole Christmas.  2001—A Beautiful Mind.  2003—The Missing.  2005—Cinderella Man.  2006—The Da Vinci Code.  2008—Frost/Nixon.  2009—Angels & Demons.  2011—The Dilemma.  2013—Rush.  2015—In the Heart of the Sea.  2016—Inferno.  2018—Solo: A Star Wars Story.  2020—Hillbilly Elegy.


Despite impressive range and an Oscar for Best Director, it’s hard to make the case for Howard as anything more than a high-grade hack.  His dull competence and constant willingness to shepherd tacky studio fare like The Da Vinci Code and How the Grinch Stole Christmas make for a prosperous career and a lousy legacy.  Diamonds in the rough like The Missing and Rush hint at a more alluring personal voice, but his work sings only once or twice per decade.  For better or worse, directors like Howard are the bread-and-butter of mainstream American cinema, delivering with pluck and precision what too often turns out to be bland commercial ephemera.  Still, he’ll always be respected and admired by those who understand that in Hollywood, survival is the ultimate virtue. 




LAWRENCE KASDAN (1949–        )


FILMS: 1981—Body Heat.  1983—The Big Chill.  1985—Silverado.  1988—The Accidental Tourist.  1990—I Love You to Death.  1991—Grand Canyon.  1994—Wyatt Earp.  1995—French Kiss.  1999—Mumford.  2003—Dreamcatcher.  2012—Darling Companion.


Kasdan’s movies are never profound or particularly artful, but they’re frequently disarming. His enthusiasm for filmmaking lends the results t a blissful energy that transcends the limitations of the films themselves.  His elevated TV-movie aesthetic evokes the classics, but only in a superficial way.  The poor man’s Spielberg.




GEORGE LUCAS (1944–        )


FILMS: 1971—THX 1138.  1973—American Graffiti.  1977—Star Wars.  1999—Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace.  2002—Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones.  2005—Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith.




MIKE NICHOLS (1931–2014)


FILMS: 1966—Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?.  1967—The Graduate.  1968—Teach Me!  1970—Catch-22.  1971—Carnal Knowledge.  1973—Day of the Dolphin.  1975—The Fortune.  1980—Gilda Live.  1983—Silkwood.  1986—Heartburn.  1988—Working Girl, Biloxi Blues.  1990—Postcards from the Edge.  1991—Regarding Henry.  1994—Wolf.  1996—The Birdcage.  1998—Primary Colors.  2000—What Planet Are You From?  2004—Closer.  2007—Charlie Wilson’s War.


Hailed as a visionary in the early stage of his career, Nichols’ lush-yet-understated approach has fallen out of style since the visual excesses of the 1990s.




NORMAN JEWISON (1926–                )


FILMS: 1962—40 Pounds of Trouble.  1963—The Thrill of It All.  1964—Send Me No Flowers.  1965—The Cincinnati Kid, The Art of Love.  1966—The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming.  1967—In the Heat of the Night.  1968—The Thomas Crown Affair.  1969—Gaily, Gaily.  1971—Fiddler on the Roof.  1973—Jesus Christ Superstar.  1975—Rollerball.  1978—F.I.S.T.  1979—...And Justice for All.  1982—Best Friends.  1984—A Soldier’s Story.  1985—Agnes of God.  1987—Moonstruck.  1989—In Country.  1991—Other People’s Money.  1994—Only You.  1995—Bogus.  1999—The Hurricane.  2001—Dinner with Friends (TV film).  2003—The Statement.


In 1968, Sarris slotted Jewison under “Strained Seriousness” alongside names like Stanley Kubrick and John Frankenheimer.  (Apparently, Sarris had a bias against the technical flourishes and stylistic deviations that would characterize New Hollywood.)  In retrospect, Sarris was as wrong about Kubrick and Frankenheimer as he was right about Jewison.  In the half-century since Sarris’ dismissed the latter as owing his success to historical timing more than talent, his work has aged like spoiled milk.  Idiotic cult objects like Rollerball and A Soldier’s Story can at least be given consolation points for ambition.  But even the fondly remembered hi jinx of Moonstruck looks shockingly unrefined in the light of day.




ROB REINER (1947–                )


FILMS: 1984—This Is Spinal Tap.  1985—The Sure Thing.  1986—Stand by Me.  1987—The Princess Bride.  1989—When Harry Met Sally…  1990—Misery.  1992—A Few Good Men.  1994—North.  1995—The American President.  1996—Ghosts of Mississippi.  1999—The Story of Us.  2003—Alex & Emma.  2005—Rumor Has It.  2007—The Bucket List.  2010—Flipped.  2012—The Magic of Belle Isle.  2014—And So It Goes.  2015—Being Charlie.  2016—LBJ.  2017—Shock and Awe.


Between 1984 and 1995, Reiner directed some of the most broadly appealing movies of their respective genres, yet it’s hard to pinpoint a personal stamp in any of them aside from a predilection for lush autumn foliage. Christopher Guest, William Goldman, Nora Ephron, and Aaron Sorkin have stronger claims of authorship over Reiner’s best films than Reiner himself.  His technique is a step above pedestrian, but he has neither the emotional nor intellectual capacity to elevate a project like When Harry Met Sally… beyond Woody Allen karaoke.  Stand by Me and Misery, similarly, suffer from the director’s inability to translate the darkness of the material.  Like Spielberg, Reiner tends to view the world through the eyes of a child.  Unlike Spielberg, he lacks the force of personality to transcend his naïveté.  Since the mid-90s, Reiner’s decline has been so steep and prolonged that most fans and critics prefer to pretend he retired after The American President.
