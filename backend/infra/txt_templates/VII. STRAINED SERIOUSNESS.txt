STRAINED SERIOUSNESS (18): 
“These are talented but uneven directors with the mortal sin of pretentiousness. Their ambitious projects tend to inflate rather than expound.”




DARREN ARONOFSKY (1969–        )


FILMS: 1998—Pi.  2000—Requiem for a Dream.  2006—The Fountain.  2008—The Wrestler.  2010—Black Swan.  2014—Noah.  2017—Mother!  2022—The Whale.


The self-conscious eccentricity of Aronofsky’s neurotic fever dreams betray a feeling of inadequacy. He’s undoubtedly a talented technician, but his persona is that of an artist in doubt of his own identity. Most of his films focus on a self-serious craftsperson whose internal dysfunction is externalized as some kind of metaphysical threat (Natalie Portman’s devious doppelganger in Black Swan, the Biblical flood of Noah, and the apocalyptic histrionics of mother!). Perhaps it was inevitable that Aronofsky’s tortured soul would eventually turn to the Old Testament for dramatic expression. What text could better articulate the anguish of a philistine in denial?




KATHRYN BIGELOW (1951–                )


FILMS: 1981—The Loveless (w/ Monty Montgomery).  1987—Near Dark.  1990—Blue Steel.  1991—Point Break.  1995—Strange Days.  2000—The Weight of Water.  2002—K-19: The Widowmaker.  2009—The Hurt Locker.  2012—Zero Dark Thirty.  2017—Detroit.


Bigelow does her best work grounding fantastical projects (Near Dark, Point Break) with atypical gravitas and verisimilitude. Her grim sense of reality at first seemed a natural fit for Mark Boal’s guerrilla journalism, but their combined styles have become the cinematic equivalent of a hat on a hat. For three straight films, they’ve obfuscated each other’s voices to the point of cacophony. In retrospect, Bigelow’s earlier, “silly” movies resonate more than her later, “serious” ones.  




KENNETH BRANAGH (1960–        )


FILMS: 1989—Henry V.  1991—Dead Again.  1992—Peter’s Friends.  1993—Much Ado About Nothing.  1994—Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein.  1995—In the Bleak Midwinter.  1996—Hamlet.  2000—Love’s Labour’s Lost.  2006—The Magic Flute, As You Like It.  2007—Sleuth.  2011—Thor.  2014—Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit.  2015—Cinderella.  2017—Murder on the Orient Express.  2018—All Is True.  2020—Artemis Fowl.  2021—Death on the Nile, Belfast.  2023—A Haunting in Venice.


Branagh is from the Cecil B. DeMille school of directors whose films eschew personality to tell a story for its own sake. Although several of his early-career Shakespeare adaptations were well received by the Academy, he was never embraced by the hipster set who were busier admiring the transgressive diversions of Tarantino and the like. More recently, Branagh has repeatedly come out in bland middle relief for Disney and others, shepherding valuable intellectual property like Cinderella and Murder on the Orient Express to a destination somewhere between the realms of mediocrity and inspiration.

FILMS: 1989—Say Anything…  1992—Singles.  1996—Jerry Maguire.  2000—Almost Famous.  2001—Vanilla Sky.  2005—Elizabethtown.  2011—We Bought a Zoo, The Union (documentary), Pearl Jam Twenty (documentary).  2015—Aloha.  2016—Roadies.  




JAMES GRAY (1951–        )


FILMS: 1994—Little Odessa.  2000—The Yards.  2007—We Own the Night.  2008—Two Lovers.  2013—The Immigrant.  2016—The Lost City of Z.  2019—Ad Astra.  




TAYLOR HACKFORD (1944–        )


FILMS:  1978—Teenage Father (short).  1980—The Idolmaker.  1982—An Officer and a Gentleman.  1984—Against All Odds.  1985—White Nights.  1987—Hail! Hail! Rock ‘n’ Roll (documentary).  1988—Everybody’s All-American.  1993—Blood In, Blood Out.  1995—Dolores Clairborne.  1997—The Devil’s Advocate.  2000—Proof of Life.  2004—Ray.  2010—Love Ranch.  2013—Parker.  2016—The Comedian.


The unfortunately named Taylor Hackford is actually an entertaining stylist whose best films ring true emotionally even when taking themselves a touch too seriously. Blunt and obvious is his preferred visual approach, but he elevates the material by directing his actors to deepen rather than dilute the nuances of their characters. While not particularly advanced in his artistic sensibility, Hackford has a rare knack for getting the most out of movie stars whose collaborations with him would, in less sensitive hands, likely be little more than forgotten footnotes in their voluminous resumes.

It’s difficult to imagine a poster of Barry Levinson ever adorning the walls of an aspiring filmmaker’s college dormitory. But for nearly two decades, Levinson was one of the industry’s most respected directors. His abrupt decline after Liberty Heights was precipitated by the slow petering out of his commercial viability, which peaked with Rain Man a decade earlier and had been diminishing ever since. Even at its height, however, Levinson’s career never seemed more significant than the movies he helmed. But the movies themselves established a pattern of quality and prestige that remains intact.

CHRISTOPHER NOLAN (1970–        )


FILMS: 1998—Following.  2000—Memento.  2002—Insomnia.  2005—Batman Begins  2006—The Prestige.  2008—The Dark Knight.  2010—Inception.  2012—The Dark Knight Rises.  2014—Interstellar.  2017—Dunkirk.  2020—Tenet.  2023—Oppenheimer.


Nolan’s reputation for stretching the limits of audience comprehension is somewhat overstated. While the language might seem esoteric, Nolan composes images with intuitive logic and uncommon command. His technique is geared more around propulsion and momentum than human sentiment. A Nolan set piece can trigger an adrenaline rush like few others, but his films as a whole tend to be diminished by the ceaselessness with which they unfold. Rather than letting a dramatic moment play out uninterrupted, Nolan prefers cross-cutting between multiple sequences. Usually making matters worse is a portentous Hans Zimmer or Ludwig Goransson score droning over the whole mess like a weighted blanket. Nolan wants his movies to feel like one long climax (or, less charitably, one long trailer), but in his relentless pursuit he too often forsakes the all-important element of stillness. He loves movement but knows nothing of dynamics. He’s obsessed with scale yet has no sense of proportion. As a result, the audience is sometimes laughing when they should be gasping and zoning out when they should be locking in.

FILMS: 1960—Murder, Inc. (w/ Burt Balaban).  1961—Question 7.  1967—Cool Hand Luke.  1969—The April Fools.  1970—Move, WUSA.  1972—Pocket Money.  1973—The Laughing Policeman.  1975—The Drowning Pool.  1976—The Voyage of the Damned.  1979—Love and Bullets.  1979—The Amityville Horror.  1980—Brubaker.  1984—The Pope of Greenwich Village.  1986—Let’s Get Harry.  1991—My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys.




JOEL SCHUMACHER (1939–2020)


FILMS: 1981—The Incredible Shrinking Woman.  1983—D.C. Cab.  1985—St. Elmo’s Fire.  1987—The Lost Boys.  1989—Cousins.  1990—Flatliners.  1991—Dying Young.  1993—Falling Down.  1994—The Client.  1995—Batman Forever.  1996—A Time to Kill.  1997—Batman & Robin.  1999—8mm, Flawless.  2000—Tigerland.  2002—Phone Booth, Bad Company.  2003—Veronica Guerin.  2004—The Phantom of the Opera.  2007—The Number 23.  2009—Blood Creek.  2010—Twelve.  2011—Trespass, Man in the Mirror (short).


Despite what some critics favorable towards Falling Down might say, profundity is not part of Schumacher’s vocabulary. His films will never be considered paragons of intellectual complexity, but his background at Parsons pays off in the joyful flamboyance of his mise-en-scene, which, along with Spielberg’s and Carpenter’s, embodied the atmosphere of American popcorn movies in the 1980s. A vibrant sense of place is his biggest strength; his best movies are bursting with color and personality. He also elicited great performances from actors of varying caliber, from charismatic young stars like Kiefer Sutherland and Jason Patric to icons like Michael Douglas.  Schumacher is a devoted maximalist for better and worse. Wild costuming, slow-motion, Biblical imagery…he wants to give us everything and lots of it. Naturally enough, some of his dishes are undercooked or over seasoned, but you’re bound to find something delicious amidst the bountiful portions.


OLIVER STONE (1946–        )


FILMS: 1974—Seizure.  1981—The Hand.  1986—Platoon, Salvador.  1987—Wall Street.  1988—Talk Radio.  1989—Born on the Fourth of July.  1991—JFK, The Doors.  1993—Heaven & Earth.  1994—Natural Born Killers.  1995—Nixon.  1997—U Turn.  1999—Any Given Sunday.  2004—Alexander.  2006—World Trade Center.  2008—W.  2010—Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps.  2012—Savages.  2016—Snowden.


JFK tends to be either over- or underrated by critics too emotionally connected to the material to analyze it with any degree of neutrality.
