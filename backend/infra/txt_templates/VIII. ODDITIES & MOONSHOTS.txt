ODDITIES & MOONSHOTS:

FILMS: 2005—The 40-Year-Old Virgin.  2007—Knocked Up.  2009—Funny People.  2012—This is 40.  2015—Trainwreck.  2017—May It Last: A Portrait of The Avett Brothers, The Zen Diaries of Garry Shandling.  2020—The King of Staten Island.  2022—The Bubble, George Carlin’s American Dream.


Judd Apatow’s career has come full circle since his early days interviewing comedians for his high school radio show. After honing his grounded, heartfelt sensibilities with Freaks and Geeks, he eventually became a good and maybe even great director of studio comedies. Yet it’s Apatow’s stewardship of 20th century stand-up comedy history that may prevail as his stronger legacy. Though Knocked Up is probably his “best” movie, Funny People is obviously his most personal in both its raw transparency and queasy sense of artistic vertigo. Apatow’s auteur status has been in decline since This is 40, but meanwhile he’s come into his own as a documentarian of subversive idols like George Carlin and Garry Shandling. Like Scorsese’s commitment to classic film preservation, Apatow’s muse is driven by a connection to cultural tradition, and a desire to document and contribute to it as best he can.

FILMS: 1993—The Man Without a Face.  1995—Braveheart.  2004—The Passion of the Christ.  2006—Apocalypto.  2016—Hacksaw Ridge.


Mel Gibson’s directed features are a startling reflection of Mel Gibson, the Actor: brash and turbulent, but not without humor, affection, and undeniable charm. Hacksaw Ridge is a film out of time, with New Testament compassion and redemption jammed uncomfortably alongside Old Testament fire and brimstone. Its war scenes reach a Biblical level of intensity, as though they deliberately aimed to top the paradigm-shifting opening of Saving Private Ryan. They feel too violent, sadistic, and relentless to be realistic, even for the Battle of Okinawa, reputedly one of the most brutal engagements of WW2. Meanwhile, Braveheart, Apocalypto, and The Passion of the Christ represent a similarly exaggerated trilogy of unparalleled pseudo-historical transpondence, less depictions of the past than brutally literal translations of it. Critics who knock Gibson for the lack of nuance in his storytelling tend to ignore its obvious power and immediacy, like poindexters too proud to acknowledge the blatant physical advantages of the biggest kid in gym class as he beats them into submission. Even if Gibson’s conclusions can’t be trusted, his talent and vision can’t be denied.

The exaggerated eccentricity of Terry Gilliam is authentic but unwieldy. His garish designs, dramatic camera angles, and penchant for broad caricature express a uniquely manic vision of the world. However, maximalism and good taste are often diametrically opposed. Gilliam’s more “prestigious” projects are weighed down by the anarchy that elevated more whimsical larks like Holy Grail and Time Bandits. His work is frequently inspired but typically unfocused, and an audience can’t sink into a story if they’re drowning in set design. This lack of buoyancy hampers even his most highly-reputed films (Brazil, The Fisher King), though it became more apparent by the mid-aughts, when tastes shifted away from the stagey sensibilities of directors like himself and fellow camp/cult favorite Tim Burton. Gilliam’s reputation reached a critical mass in the early ‘90s before he demolished the fine line between style and gimmickry with Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Though it never fully recovered, Gilliam’s career now exemplifies how high a director could once soar on the power of pure imagination.

After a run of iconic action thrillers in the late ‘80s, the fact that McTiernan’s turbulent career was ultimately undone by felonious squabbling over a project as silly as the Rollerball remake is Hollywood tragicomedy of the highest order. Nevertheless, no action director besides Tony Scott looms larger in the memory of Generation X. McTiernan’s tactile sense of place and decidedly right-wing sensibilities went out of fashion by the late 90s, and American critics left him behind after the disastrous The 13th Warrior. Given the cloud of nostalgia surrounding his early films, it’s hard to gauge the exact measure of McTiernan’s worth, though it’s probably fair to say his red-blooded style has grown underrated by contemporary standards.

Minghella’s polished classicism may be impenetrable to modern audiences, but throughout his distinguished and tragically foreshortened career he demonstrated a consistently tasteful, melancholic point of view. Evoking the literary ambitions of David Lean but with a brisker attention to pace, Minghella’s films are about construction and excavation. Like his beautiful-looking characters, the handsome, elegant surfaces of his worlds gradually crack apart, revealing ugly scars and hidden malice. The rich period details of The English Patient and The Talented Mr. Ripley reflect the opulent fictions within which their titular protagonists shroud their mysterious origins. The former’s Best Picture Oscar win over Fargo has been retroactively decried as the triumph of staid establishmentarianism over dangerous originality, but the irony is that the formal craftsmanship of The English Patient is miles beyond what we’ve come to expect from even the most daring of contemporary projects.

His unyielding naturalism is too dry or pretentious for some tastes, but his early work helped raise the stakes of New Hollywood grit, pushing the boundaries of mainstream drama into bolder territory. His legacy remains tied to the sensitive, confident performances he elicited from soon-to-be iconic actors like Al Pacino and Gene Hackman.

M. Night Shyamalan’s divisive reputation is a function of how his particular style (symbolist as opposed to realist, impressionistic instead of naturalistic) is often misunderstood by critics and audiences at large. Because of their schematic designs, idiosyncratic rhythms, and tonal ambiguities, Shyamalan’s films invite all kinds of analytical New Criticism type readings in which the writer maps whatever particular critical lens (feminist, Marxist, autofictional, etc.) is most of interest. 


Like most promising young directors after a major hit, he was slapped with the “next Spielberg” label, but this comparison is only accurate insofar as it relates to his most obvious and consistent themes: the fraught relationship between parents and children, the redemptive love and power of the nuclear family unit. As a director, he’s much more closely aligned to the tradition of Alfred Hitchcock, and as a writer favors a symbolist style that aims to elevate contemporary ordinary life into grandiose, fable-like mythology. 


The Happening, reviled upon release by most critics, is one such symbolist work that, in the tradition of deceptively profound B-movie premised masterpieces like The Birds and Invasion of the Body Snatchers, supports many possible readings, including climate change, post-9/11 trauma, and pre-COVID anxiety. However, the strongest hidden theme is also perhaps the one least commented upon: white American guilt over slavery and racial segregation. Consider the film’s conspicuous lack of black characters, or even extras, highly unusual especially given its geographic setting in the northeast metropolitan areas of New York and Philadelphia. The ritualistic manner in which this seemingly all-white population commits suicide makes literal the 21st century tendency among white artists, scholars, academics, and journalists towards self-flagellation in obsequious (and often performative) deference to non-white voices and cultural perspectives. While the toxin is presented initially as an unexplained natural phenomenon, metaphorically it suggests a latent fear among America’s complacent white middle class majority that they must pay for the sins their ancestors have committed, and the rest of the movie is a chillingly prescient catalogue of their hypothetical response to such a reckoning. 
A similar reading of The Shining in relation to American crimes against the indigenous has also appeared in some critical circles, due to certain Native American visual motifs hidden within Kubrick’s rendition of the Overlook hotel. The same kinds of subliminal symbolic signals crop up in The Happening again and again. After our characters evacuate Philadelphia, the film presents a long string of subversive allusions to the imagery and iconography of antebellum slavery, Jim Crow era segregation, and modern day racial division: white bodies hanging from trees, a white zookeeper passively torn apart by lions (an inversion of runaway slaves and civil rights protesters mauled by dogs), two unarmed teenagers, one white and one black, shot to death in a moment of escalating desperation. When our main characters finally do find refuge, it is with a distrustful old woman who shelters them only with reluctance, casting paranoid aspersions on them at every turn. After she too succumbs to the toxin (which could be interpreted alternatively as self-annihilating identity politics or racial prejudice itself, two sides of the same coin) our main characters are separated from each other. In a stark and hauntingly poetic example of black-white role reversal, they find a way to communicate through a specialized tube connecting the main house to a shelter that formerly served as a stop on the Underground Railroad, surrounded on the outside by a silently hostile environment.

Time has ultimately worked in Woo’s favor. His phantasmagoric gun-fu operas make up in wit and imagination what they lack in tonal consistency and logical coherence. Plenty of auteurs sexualize violence, but none more blatantly than Woo. The perversity of these films is remarkable given how conservative (and even homophobic) the subtexts skew. Consider how many of his stories revolve around an intense emotional connection between a prudish hero and flamboyant villain, with the former rejecting the unwanted advances of the latter in spectacular (and frequently phallic) fashion. In Face/Off, Travolta’s devious character is killed with a spear gun, while his heel turn in Broken Arrow culminates in what can only be described as death by nuclear penetration. Many action directors of the ‘90s and early aughts learned all the wrong lessons from Woo, and it wasn’t until Doug Liman’s The Bourne Identity that the genre was saved from total decadence into nauseously edited, shoot-em-up spectacle. But now that the pendulum of action filmmaking has swung back towards the realist side of the spectrum, Woo’s films have acquired a wistful resonance for those who appreciate the pure poetry of dressing a bombastic action sequence with an aviary’s worth of unexplained doves.
